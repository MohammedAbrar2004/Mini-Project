# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. Here are some suggestions:

### Design Guidelines
- Use the Veritas brand colors (purple gradient: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Include a magnifying glass or fact-check symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use transparent backgrounds for better integration

### Quick Icon Creation
1. **Online Tools**: Use Canva, Figma, or similar tools
2. **AI Generation**: Use DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar for icon generation
3. **Icon Libraries**: Adapt icons from Feather Icons, Heroicons, etc.

### Temporary Solution
For testing, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders.

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
